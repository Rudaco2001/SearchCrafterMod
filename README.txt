This mod was made only for version 1.19.2 of minecraft with Forge
Mod that allows to access the contents of all of your nearby chests, and use them to craft the desired item(s). The area that the block will check and search for chests is the specified in the range input (to the right when opening the block interface). In the interface there will be two main tabs. The craft tab is where you will be able to select any item of the game to try to craft it. Once pressed, two smaller lists will appear at the right, the left one being the items that that will be used for the craft(the ones you already have), and the right one being a list of the items you will need to gather to be able to craft the item (note that if you need any type of wood, the block will tell you only one specific type, but any of them will be accepted if introduced). The right main tab is for seeing the actual contents of your chests in the specified area. You can exctract any of the items at your will without any restriction. Additionally if the result of crafting something should return some materials (for example when trying to craft 1 stick with a log of wood, there would be 3 sticks and 2 planks remaining of the crafting process), the crafter will search for a chest that is next to it to insert the remaining items there. If no chest is present, the itmes will be dropped on the floor instead.
The mod uses an algorithm to search trough all of the possible crafting items, wich could be translated in an exponential growth depending on the item that is being crafted. When the algorithm takes too long to finish (aprx. 10 seconds) it will stop, and change to a simpler algorithm that will finish the given task faster, showing a message in the chat. Note that this simpler algorithm could not detect everytime that you have the necessary items to craft something. For example if you have a log to try to craft a wooden sword it may not detect it and say you need some planks. This only happens when there are several variants of a block such as wood, as the algorithm can not search trough all of them in the given time.
